ActsAsObfuscated
================

Add support to ActiveRecord::Base for id obfuscation, i.e. instead of
.../users/show/1 you get .../users/show/cXdbpx completely transparently

Install
=======

script/plugin install git://github.com/ross/acts_as_obfuscated.git

Example
=======

Just add acts_as_obfuscated to the desired model objects:

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_obfuscated

  ...
end

and that's it. 

$ ./script/console 
Loading development environment (Rails 2.3.4)
>> u = User.create(:name => 'Bob')
=> #<User id: 4, name: "Bob", created_at: "2009-09-19 04:53:43", updated_at: "2009-09-19 04:53:43">
>> u.id
=> 4
>> u.eid
=> "diBGnp"
>> User.find(u.id)
=> #<User id: 4, name: "Bob", created_at: "2009-09-19 04:53:43", updated_at: "2009-09-19 04:53:43">
>> User.find(u.eid)
=> #<User id: 4, name: "Bob", created_at: "2009-09-19 04:53:43", updated_at: "2009-09-19 04:53:43">

acts_as_obfuscated doesn't stop you from adding custom to_param functions, so
long as the first portion is the eid followed by a '-':

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_obfuscated

  has_many(:toys)

  def to_param
    CGI.escape("#{super.to_param}-#{self.name}").gsub(/\./, '_')
  end
end

$ ./script/console 
Loading development environment (Rails 2.3.4)
u= U>> u= User.last
=> #<User id: 4, name: "Bob", created_at: "2009-09-19 04:53:43", updated_at: "2009-09-19 04:53:43">
>> u.to_param
=> "diBGnp-Bob"
>> User.find(u.to_param)
=> #<User id: 4, name: "Bob", created_at: "2009-09-19 04:53:43", updated_at: "2009-09-19 04:53:43">
